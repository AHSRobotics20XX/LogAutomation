# Custom Log Automation Tool
## From Team #6545 Knight Riders
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was made to reduce time-waste during the process of coding and testing autonomous programs. It is made entirely from Java and only uses FTC provided materials. No 3rd party dependecies are in use.

There are example programs in the "Custom/TeleOp/Examples/" folder explaining how to use and implement the custom classes into your own programs.
There is also class documentation in the "Custom/TeleOp/" folder that goes into what each method does and what is available to you

For a Helper Tool also develeoped by me, go to this link.
